      <description>&lt;p&gt;I wanted to make a sudoku solver using backtracking, a project only slightly less common than a todo app. I was genuinely expecting it to take an afternoon and I could be done with it, but as all my projects go, there were a lot of setbacks. Even now, it&amp;rsquo;s not as good as I want it to be, and I&amp;rsquo;ll keep iterating on it. For now let&amp;rsquo;s say this is&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Why I won&#39;t be using CMake on my CLI chess app</title>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;the-mistake&#34;&gt;The Mistake&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recently started making a chess app called &lt;code&gt;chessCLI&lt;/code&gt;. The goal is for it to be a CLI interface to play chess and eventually host it on my server so that you can run it just using &lt;code&gt;curl&lt;/code&gt;. Even in its earliest version, it was already the largest C++ project I had ever made, and so manually building wasn&amp;rsquo;t an option. I had already done a lot of projects in C because my first introduction to programming was in a programming school called 42 which taught in C, so I was already quite comfortable with Make, but I wanted to see what else was out there.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
