This got tedious after 2 times so I made a little shell script compile.sh and added it to the repository:\n#!/bin/bash mkdir build cd build cmake .. cmake --build . Until now this has worked fine but I really didn’t like having to run a shell script to compile my code, as well as not actually understanding how CMake works behind the hood or if multi-platform compatibility even mattered considering the end goal was a curl-able app.\nSo I did some more extensive research into Make and re-discovered why I love this build system. It’s incredibly simple, yet totally customizable. I highly recommend this video by Gabriel Parmer if you want to learn about Make, as it truly is the resource that helped me the most.\nThe Hero I Needed At first glance, Make doesn’t seem all that different to a shell script, essentially just running commands like g++ main.cpp or anything else you give it, but the deeper you dive, the more you’ll see how powerful this simple tool can really be.\nRules Inside your Makefile you can set rules. Rules tell Make how to make a certain file. So for example, a simple Makefile for a simple app could look like:\nmy_app: g++ main.cpp -o my_app This tells Make that to generate the file my_app, it just needs to run the commands underneath that rule to create that file.\nHowever, make can be used not just to make files, one very common example of this is something like:\nclean: rm -rf $(OBJS) If you assume that $(OBJS) is a variable containing the object files created as an intermediate step of compilation, this line simply deletes those object files. But the true beauty is in the fact that this rule now allows you to run just those instructions with make clean. No random directory, no --build, just that. I’ve also seen rules such as fclean to do a full clean (including the binary).\nBut it gets even better. After the colon, you can specify some prerequisites that MUST be done before that rule gets executed. So going back to that simple example, we should expand it to look like:\nmy_app: main.cpp g++ main.cpp -o my_app This tells Make that to create the file my_app, it must have the file main.cpp before it can generate it. So now if we don’t have main.cpp, Make will throw an error instead of the compiler.\nVariables We can also set variables in Make, which helps in not having refactors take forever. Here are some common variables I see in a lot of Makefiles, which I have used in my own:\nCC = g++ CFLAGS = -Wall -Werror -Wextra SRCS = some.c \\ list.c \\ of.c \\ files.c OBJS = $(SRC:.c=.o) BIN = bin You can probably start to see what these are used for, since now we can replace our simple Makefile with:\n$(BIN): $(SRCS) $(CC) $(SRCS) -o $(BIN) By default, running make will execute the first rule, so a common practice is to have the first rule be all:\nall: $(BIN) Note that in this case, we don’t specify any actual commands to be run in that rule, and that’s totally fine. We’re just allowing make to default into creating the binary.\nThere’s so much more about Make that I might talk about in another post but I’ll finish with one of my favorite rules:\n%.o: %.c $(CC) $(CFLAGS) -c -o $@ $^ ",

<p>I recently started making a chess app called <code>chessCLI</code>.

I had already done a lot of projects in C because my first introduction to programming was in a programming school called 42 which taught in C, so I was already quite comfortable with Make, but I wanted to see what else was out there.</p>
